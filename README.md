## Module #2 

  I am tasked with integrating csv data and dataframes into a project on jupyter lab and with a .ipynb file. I was able to decipher the data given and successfully extract it in a organized, and useful manner.
  I will need to define data frames and csv files in jupyter lab, and insert the provided csv file into the jupyter notebook/project. I will also need to be able to read csv files. Lastly, I will need to find the summation of the Profit/Losses data, the average changes, greatest increase, and greatest decrease. 
  
### Concepts
  For this assignment I used my attained knowledge in Pandas, Jupyter Labs/Notebook/, and Anaconda to name a few.

  With the new knowledge I was able to define csv files, and dataframes. This ability was used as my foundation to be able to complete the tasks that were assigned to me and I was able to create an clean and accurate financial anyalysis.
